    '''
    Homework for July 11th
    1. add 3 more locations to sample_locations.json, and add commands to connect them to the existing locations
    then try to simulate these commands to verify they work by adding it to line 187 in the commands list of the simulation
    2. in simulation.py, add a modification to generate_events function, where if the command is "Undo", 
    it will go back to the previous location, and add an event for that location
    3. Currently we can only run the game via the simulator by pre-defining all commands at once, this is a bit un-natural.
    in the SimpleAdventureGame class, add a method called run_game that will allow the user to play the game interactively,
    you would want to do this by using a while loop to keep asking the user for commands until they choose to quit.
